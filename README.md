## Branching Notes

This will list ways to create and manage branches.

`git branch` - list branches you have locally, and highlight the one you're using.

`git branch BRANCH_NAME` - creates a new branch called BRANCH_NAME

`git checkout BRANCH_NAME` - switches to that branch

`git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` - creates AND switches to the branch
